# Causes-of-Deaths-Worldwide
The goal of the proposed report is to draw some insights on the deaths happend from 1990 to 2019, discovering the most relevant causes,  where they occurred or which category was more affected

According to the data provided, our focus is on 2 groups through which we want to draw
some insights: the age groups and the WHO regions (it refers to the division of the world
provided by the World Health Organization for the purpose of reporting, analysis and
administration).
1) Considering the WHO regions:
- Which is the most common cause of death?
- In which WHO regions do we observe the highest number of deaths?
- How did the number of deaths change from 1990 to 2019?
- Taking into consideration the time frame, can we draw some insights?
2) Considering the age groups:
- Which is the most common cause of death?
- In which age group do we observe the highest number of deaths?
- Where do we observe the highest number of deaths?
- Taking into consideration the time frame, can we draw some insights?
3) Which is the general trend? Do we notice a decrease or an increase in
deaths from 1990 to 2019?
